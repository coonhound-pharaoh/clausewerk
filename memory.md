# Decision record

One record per important decision, newest first. Plain language.

Detailed engineering write-ups live in [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/); this file is the
running log of *what we decided and why*, readable without opening the code.

## 2026-07-25 · What we concede and what we stand for are different records

**Decision.** Accepting a vendor's wording is a **concession** — a note that on *this one deal* we
agreed to something other than our standard position. It does not change the library. The next deal
still starts from our standard position.

Changing the library is a separate, deliberate decision by Legal. Replacing a clause outright is a
third thing again, called **supersession**, and it keeps the old version on file permanently.

**Why.** Today the system does all three with one action: accept a vendor's redline and it quietly
becomes approved language for everyone. That means the library drifts toward whatever vendors
pushed hardest on, and nobody ever decided that should happen.

**The commercial payoff.** Once concessions are recorded properly, we have something we have never
had: a structured record of what we actually give away, to whom, at what deal size. That record is
what the strategic library gets built from.

**Also decided.** Signed agreements carrying replaced language get flagged at renewal, showing what
changed and why. That is what makes keeping old versions worth doing rather than just tidy.

## 2026-07-25 · The library gets a documented retreat path

**Decision.** Each risk area gets a **ladder**: our preferred position, an acceptable fallback, and
a floor we do not go below. Every rung is proper approved language written by a lawyer.

**Why this is the big one.** Today, when a vendor pushes back on anything, it goes to Legal. That
makes Legal the bottleneck on every negotiation. With a ladder, Legal approves the retreat path
once, in advance — so the system can settle common push-backs on its own, and Legal only sees the
asks that fall below the floor.

In plain terms: **Legal's involvement moves from every deal to every category, occasionally.** That
is the difference between a system that scales and one that doesn't.

**The floor is absolute.** No confidence score, no auto-approve, and no shortcut gets past it.

## 2026-07-25 · The library learns from what we gave away

**Decision.** The system counts patterns in our concessions and proposes library changes for Legal
to accept or reject. For example: *"we conceded this point on 14 of 17 deals, always to the same
position — our standard position may be fiction."*

**Why.** If we always concede the same point, our written standard is not our real standard, and
everyone wastes time discovering that deal by deal.

**Guardrail.** These are proposals with the evidence attached, never automatic changes, and the
software never writes contract language. It counts; lawyers decide.

**Note.** This data is commercially sensitive — it is a summary of exactly what we will give away
under pressure. It stays internal to Legal and Audit and must never appear in anything vendor-facing.

## 2026-07-25 · Lawyers write the contradiction rules, not developers

**Decision.** The rules that detect contradictions in a contract are written and approved by
attorneys, through the same approval process as clause wording — not by engineers changing code.

**Correction.** I had framed this as a code-review question. That was wrong: the sample clauses are
placeholders, and in practice attorneys own this.

**What it means for the build.** The rules need a proper authoring screen for non-technical users,
version control, effective dates, and a named approver — the same treatment clause wording gets.
Every warning the system raises must say which version of which rule produced it.

## 2026-07-25 · Keep the simple matcher as the backup

**Decision.** When we upgrade the vendor-redline matcher to smarter search, we keep the current
simple keyword method as the offline backup.

**Why.** Otherwise negotiation becomes the only part of Clausewerk that stops working when the AI
is unavailable, and we lose the ability to say the whole system runs without it.

**Watch out for.** The two methods must score things on the same scale, or our confidence threshold
means different things depending on which one is running.

---

## 2026-07-25 · Auto-approve must leave a trace

**Decision.** Every time someone approves a vendor's change, the system now records whether the
software was recommending that approval, how confident it was, and what the confidence bar was set
to.

**Why.** We can now measure how often people simply agree with the machine. If that number is very
high, the human review step has quietly stopped being a review, and we would want to know before an
auditor tells us.

**Worth knowing.** The "auto-approve" setting never actually approved anything on its own — it only
displayed a hint and a person still clicked. We have also reserved a separate record type so that
if the software is ever allowed to approve by itself, it can never be mistaken in the records for a
person's decision.

## 2026-07-25 · A requester can override a warning, but not alone

**Decision.** When the system flags a serious contradiction in a contract, the business requester
can ask to proceed anyway — but it becomes a request, not an instant action. Relevant people are
notified, a lawyer approves or rejects it, and every step is recorded. Approval is given warning by
warning, not as one blanket "proceed".

**Why.** Blocking people entirely just pushes the work outside the system, where nothing is
recorded. Letting one person clear a warning instantly turns a real control into a speed bump. A
request that others can see is the middle path.

**Also decided.** We are adding a **Viewer** role — someone who can read a contract but change
nothing. Today the only way to show a contract to a colleague is to give them the ability to edit
it, which makes the notification step above impossible to do safely.

**Cost, openly.** This adds delay to exactly the deals that are already in a hurry. Expect pressure
to shorten or skip the notification window.

## 2026-07-25 · Expiry warnings at every round, and a hard stop at signature

**Decision.** Approved language has an expiry date. The system now re-checks every clause in a
contract at **each negotiation round** and again **at signature**. Language that has gone stale
blocks signing; language expiring soon shows as a warning.

**Why.** Negotiations run for weeks. A clause that was approved when the draft was built can lapse
before anyone signs, and nothing used to notice.

**The rule that makes it safe.** Once a contract is signed, later changes to our clause library
never affect it. A signed contract stays exactly as signed. Stale language gets replaced at
renewal, not retroactively.

## 2026-07-25 · Lifecycle management: obligations come from the clause, never from reading the contract

**Decision.** We are adding the lifecycle system (see
[`LIFECYCLE-ARCHITECTURE.md`](LIFECYCLE-ARCHITECTURE.md)). Its foundation: what a contract obliges
us to do is recorded **on the approved clause itself**, written by Legal when the clause is
approved. Registering a signed contract is then a lookup, not an interpretation.

**Why this is the whole point.** Most contract-management products read finished contracts and
guess what they mean. We never have to. Every sentence in our contracts got there by referencing an
approved clause, so we already know precisely what we committed to. No software is ever asked to
read a contract and decide what it requires.

**Consequence to plan for.** Legal has to write those obligations onto the clauses. For a
500-clause library that is a real backlog, and it is the main cost of this decision.

**Deliberately excluded.** Contracts written on the other side's paper have no approved clauses
behind them, so they cannot be registered automatically. Including them would import exactly the
guesswork we are avoiding.

## 2026-07-25 · Fix the software, not the demo

**Decision.** Eight defects were found and all eight were fixed in the working prototype rather
than documented and left.

**The two that mattered most.**

1. Retired and expired clauses could still be chosen for a new contract. The safety switch worked
   for standard boilerplate and not for the risk-driven clauses — the ones that matter.
2. The check that stops the AI inventing a risk category would silently let everything through if a
   configuration file failed to load. It now refuses and falls back to the rule-based method
   instead.

**A judgement call worth recording.** Fixing the expiry clock revealed that 54 of our 102 sample
clauses have no approval date recorded at all. The old code invented one, which made them look
expired. We chose **not** to invent dates in software. Those clauses are now flagged as missing
their paperwork. Filling that in is Legal's job, and hiding it in code would only have buried the
problem again.

## 2026-07-25 · A protection that worked by accident is not a protection

**What happened.** While building the concession record, our test proved that a
read-only Viewer could not see concession data. It passed — but for the wrong
reason. The rule was tripping over an unrelated permission on a different table,
not actually enforcing "viewers may not see this."

Had anyone later adjusted that unrelated permission, the most commercially
sensitive data we hold — the record of what we concede under pressure — would
have become visible, and the test would still have said everything was fine.

**Why it was caught.** Not by the tests. By the deliberate practice of breaking
each protection on purpose and checking the tests notice. That practice has now
caught three faults the normal tests missed.

**Decision.** Keep doing it, and treat "the test passed" as a weaker claim than
"the test failed when we broke the thing it guards."

## 2026-07-25 · Contradiction rules are written by lawyers, so they are data

**Decision.** Following the decision that attorneys own the contradiction rules,
the rules are now stored as data rather than written as software.

**How it works in plain terms.** Lawyers label approved wording with short tags —
"this clause is governed by New York law", "this indemnity is uncapped", "this
covers regulated data". A rule is then a simple statement about those labels:
*"warn if two clauses name different jurisdictions"*, or *"warn if we handle
regulated data and carry no cyber insurance"*.

**Why this matters.** No rule ever reads contract wording and interprets it. It
only checks labels a lawyer applied deliberately. That keeps the same discipline
as everything else: judgement is recorded by a person, and the software only
counts.

**The deliberate limitation.** The rule language has exactly three building
blocks and nothing else — no calculations, no conditions, no logic. All four
rules in our specification are expressible with them. If counsel needs something
these cannot say, we add a fourth building block on purpose. An open-ended rule
language would just be programming with no approval step in front of it.

**Also decided.** Rules are versioned and cannot be edited once published, and
every warning names the exact rule version that raised it. Editing a live rule
would rewrite the record of why past contracts were blocked.
