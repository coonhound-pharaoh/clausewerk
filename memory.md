# Decision record

One record per important decision, newest first. Plain language.

Detailed engineering write-ups live in [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/); this file is the
running log of *what we decided and why*, readable without opening the code.

## 2026-07-25 · Auto-approve must leave a trace

**Decision.** Every time someone approves a vendor's change, the system now records whether the
software was recommending that approval, how confident it was, and what the confidence bar was set
to.

**Why.** We can now measure how often people simply agree with the machine. If that number is very
high, the human review step has quietly stopped being a review, and we would want to know before an
auditor tells us.

**Worth knowing.** The "auto-approve" setting never actually approved anything on its own — it only
displayed a hint and a person still clicked. We have also reserved a separate record type so that
if the software is ever allowed to approve by itself, it can never be mistaken in the records for a
person's decision.

## 2026-07-25 · A requester can override a warning, but not alone

**Decision.** When the system flags a serious contradiction in a contract, the business requester
can ask to proceed anyway — but it becomes a request, not an instant action. Relevant people are
notified, a lawyer approves or rejects it, and every step is recorded. Approval is given warning by
warning, not as one blanket "proceed".

**Why.** Blocking people entirely just pushes the work outside the system, where nothing is
recorded. Letting one person clear a warning instantly turns a real control into a speed bump. A
request that others can see is the middle path.

**Also decided.** We are adding a **Viewer** role — someone who can read a contract but change
nothing. Today the only way to show a contract to a colleague is to give them the ability to edit
it, which makes the notification step above impossible to do safely.

**Cost, openly.** This adds delay to exactly the deals that are already in a hurry. Expect pressure
to shorten or skip the notification window.

## 2026-07-25 · Expiry warnings at every round, and a hard stop at signature

**Decision.** Approved language has an expiry date. The system now re-checks every clause in a
contract at **each negotiation round** and again **at signature**. Language that has gone stale
blocks signing; language expiring soon shows as a warning.

**Why.** Negotiations run for weeks. A clause that was approved when the draft was built can lapse
before anyone signs, and nothing used to notice.

**The rule that makes it safe.** Once a contract is signed, later changes to our clause library
never affect it. A signed contract stays exactly as signed. Stale language gets replaced at
renewal, not retroactively.

## 2026-07-25 · Lifecycle management: obligations come from the clause, never from reading the contract

**Decision.** We are adding the lifecycle system (see
[`LIFECYCLE-ARCHITECTURE.md`](LIFECYCLE-ARCHITECTURE.md)). Its foundation: what a contract obliges
us to do is recorded **on the approved clause itself**, written by Legal when the clause is
approved. Registering a signed contract is then a lookup, not an interpretation.

**Why this is the whole point.** Most contract-management products read finished contracts and
guess what they mean. We never have to. Every sentence in our contracts got there by referencing an
approved clause, so we already know precisely what we committed to. No software is ever asked to
read a contract and decide what it requires.

**Consequence to plan for.** Legal has to write those obligations onto the clauses. For a
500-clause library that is a real backlog, and it is the main cost of this decision.

**Deliberately excluded.** Contracts written on the other side's paper have no approved clauses
behind them, so they cannot be registered automatically. Including them would import exactly the
guesswork we are avoiding.

## 2026-07-25 · Fix the software, not the demo

**Decision.** Eight defects were found and all eight were fixed in the working prototype rather
than documented and left.

**The two that mattered most.**

1. Retired and expired clauses could still be chosen for a new contract. The safety switch worked
   for standard boilerplate and not for the risk-driven clauses — the ones that matter.
2. The check that stops the AI inventing a risk category would silently let everything through if a
   configuration file failed to load. It now refuses and falls back to the rule-based method
   instead.

**A judgement call worth recording.** Fixing the expiry clock revealed that 54 of our 102 sample
clauses have no approval date recorded at all. The old code invented one, which made them look
expired. We chose **not** to invent dates in software. Those clauses are now flagged as missing
their paperwork. Filling that in is Legal's job, and hiding it in code would only have buried the
problem again.
